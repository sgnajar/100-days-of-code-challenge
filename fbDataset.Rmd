## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Reading in the tab separated file // read.csv or read.delim
```{r}
getwd()
list.files()
inFile <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep= '\t')
## inFile2 <- read.delim('pseudo_facebook.tsv')
names(inFile)
```

## Histogram of Users' Birthdays + faceting
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = inFile, x = dob_day) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:31) +
  facet_wrap(~dob_month, ncol = 3)
```

## question here is based on the dataset, how many friend you got and if you post on fb, how many audience you have

## Friend Count
```{r}
qplot(data = inFile, x = friend_count, xlim = c(0,1000))
qplot(data = inFile, x = friend_count) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1000))
```
## Adjusting the binwidth
```{r}
qplot(data = inFile, x = friend_count, binwidth = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))
```

## faceting and divide the histogram into two plot, based on their gender, male and female, there was an  extra plot of NA, so here this code is going to omit NA plot
## or use data = na.omit(inFile)

```{r}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), binwidth = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```


## box plots
## Using boxplot of friend count by gender instead of histogram, we can see the differences between the median of the two groups.
```{r}
qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom = 'boxplot', ylim = c(0,1000))

qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom = 'boxplot') +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1000))

qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom = 'boxplot') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1000))

```

```{r}
qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom = 'boxplot') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 250))
## to console
by(inFile$friend_count, inFile$gender, summary)

```

## who initiated more friendships in the dataset? men or female?
```{r}
qplot(x = gender, y = friendships_initiated, 
      data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom = 'boxplot') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 150))
## to console
by(inFile$friendships_initiated, inFile$gender, sum)
by(inFile$friendships_initiated, inFile$gender, summary)

```

## who has more fb friends? male or female?
## Statistics 'by' Gender
```{r}
table(inFile$gender)
by(inFile$friend_count, inFile$gender, summary)
```

## Tenure, how many years using fb
```{r}
qplot(data = inFile, x = tenure/365, binwidth = .25,
      color = I('black'), fill = I('#099009')) +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,7,1), limits = c(0,7)) +
      xlab('Number of years using fb') +
      ylab('Number of users in sample')
```

summary(inFile$age)
## User Ages
```{r}
qplot(data = inFile, x = age, binwidth = 1,
      color = I('black'), fill = I('#094009')) +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(133,113,5)) +
      xlab('Ages using fb') +
      ylab('Number of users in sample')
```

## Transforming friend_count data 
```{r}
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
summary(inFile$friend_count)
summary(log10(inFile$friend_count + 1))
summary(sqrt(inFile$friend_count))
p1 <- qplot(data = inFile, x = friend_count)
p2 <- qplot(data = inFile, x = log10(friend_count + 1))
p3 <- qplot(data = inFile, x = sqrt(friend_count))
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)
```

## Transforming friend_count data using scales
```{r}
p4 <- ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = inFile) + geom_histogram()
p5 <- p4 + scale_x_log10()
p6 <- p4 + scale_x_sqrt()

grid.arrange(p4, p5, p6, ncol = 1)
```

## Adding a scaling layer
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
logScale <- qplot(x = log10(friend_count), data = inFile)
countScale <- ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = inFile) + geom_histogram() + scale_x_log10()
grid.arrange(logScale, countScale, ncol = 2)

qplot(data = inFile, x = friend_count) + scale_x_log10()
```

## who on average has more friends? men or female, created histogram before, now creating frequency polygons instead
## Frequency Polygons
```{r}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), binwidth = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)

qplot(x = friend_count, data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)), binwidth = 10, geom = 'freqpoly', color = gender) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))

## still this plot does not answer the proposed question but if we change y-axis scale, we can see that male have higher friend counts on average than women

qplot(x = friend_count, y = ..count../sum(..count..), 
      data = subset(inFile, !is.na(gender)),
      xlab = 'Friend count',
      ylab = 'Proportion of Users with that friend count',
      binwidth = 10, geom = 'freqpoly', color = gender) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))

```

## determine which gender creates more likes on the world wide web ("www_likes")
```{r}
qplot(x = www_likes, 
      data = subset(inFile,!is.na(gender)),
     geom = 'freqpoly', color = gender) +
  scale_x_continuous() + scale_x_log10()
## print to console
by(inFile$www_likes, inFile$gender, sum)
```

## sometimes variables have lots of zero values
## logical solution
## what percent of check in using mobile?

```{r}
summary(inFile$mobile_likes)
summary(inFile$mobile_likes > 0)
## booleans ifelse(..., 1, 0)
## 1: checked in using mobile
## 0: checked in not using mobile
mobile_checkedIn <- NA
inFile$mobile_checkedIn <- ifelse(inFile$mobile_likes > 0, 1, 0)
inFile$mobile_checkedIn <- factor(inFile$mobile_checkedIn)
summary(inFile$mobile_checkedIn)
sum(inFile$mobile_checkedIn == 1) / length(inFile$mobile_checkedIn)
```


# Create a line graph of the proportion of friendships initiated ('prop_initiated') vs. tenure and color the line segment by year_joined.bucket.
```{r}
fb <- inFile %>%
  mutate(year_joined = floor(2014 - tenure/365),
         year_joined_bucket = cut(year_joined, breaks=c(2004, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014))) 

## Adding in 0's for the mean function instead of leaving out NA's gives a better approximation 
## for the proportion of friendships initiated for this plot.

fb2 <- fb %>%
    mutate(prop_initiated = ifelse(friend_count > 0, friendships_initiated/friend_count, 0))

ggplot(subset(fb2, tenure > 0), aes(x=tenure, y=prop_initiated)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=year_joined_bucket), stat='summary', fun.y=mean) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
